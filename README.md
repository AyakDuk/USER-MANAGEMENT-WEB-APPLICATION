### Proposed Solution
This application provides a structured user management system that:
- Enables secure user registration and login
- Stores user data centrally in a database
- Allows users to view and manage their profiles
- Lays the foundation for tracking user engagement and growth

---

### Value Delivered
- Improved user onboarding experience
- Centralized and structured user data
- Reduced administrative overhead
- Measurable insights into user behavior
